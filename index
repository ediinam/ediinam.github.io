<p class="text-center"> “What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.”<br> 
― J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye</p>

<p class="text-center">“I think... if it is true that <br>
						there are as many minds as there <br>

<p class="text-center">“Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing <br>

						I'll meet you there.<br>
						When the soul lies down in that grass <br>
						the world is too full to talk about.” <br>
